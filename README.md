A repo made for Among Us Scripts written in AutoIT

I created these scripts just for fun, which automate the "Fix Wiring" and "Calibrate Distributor" tasks in Among Us.  
The coordinates of the pixels are hardcoded for a 1080p game in Windows.

_For different resolutions, the coordinates of the pixels need to be adjusted accordingly in .au3 files. Afterwards, new executables can be compiled using AutoIT._ 

`FixWiring - Fullscreen.exe` and `Calibrate Distributor.exe` will work on a full-screen game. `FixWiring - WindowedFullScreen.exe`will work on a windowed full-screen game.

Usage: 
- The executables can be assigned to a key press to work as a macro.

Fix Wiring will automatically bind the wires in this task:

Calibrate Distributor will automatically click on the buttons in correct order in this task:
